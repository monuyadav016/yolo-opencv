# yolo-opencv
A python implementation of yolov3 using opencv

The GUI folder holds the PyQt5 GUI for managing the program and is the simplest to use. Copy the coco.names, yolov3.cfg and yolov3.weights (or any other dataset, config and wweights files) in the same directory as the ODv1.py and object_classifier_gui.py.

The CUI folder holds the object_classifier_cli.py file that can be run to interact and detect objects using the Terminal. Copy the coco.names, yolov3.cfg and yolov3.weights (or any other dataset, config and wweights files) in the same directory as the ODv1.py and object_classifier_cli.py.

Yolo-site is a demo project in progress to implement the classifier on the web using the Django Framework.  Copy the coco.names, yolov3.cfg and yolov3.weights (or any other dataset, config and wweights files) in the /yolo_site/website/ directory.
